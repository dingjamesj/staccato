/* Examples of .stkl and .sply file structures:

NOTE: new lines are only there for visual purposes---they don't exist in the actual binary files.
      (the actual binary files are just series of chars)

.stkl file format:

File version
Track title 1
\0
Artist 1
\0
Artist 2
\0
\0      <-- Note that two null chars separate the artists list and the album since one null char separates each artist.
Album
\0
Path 1
\0
Track title 2
\0
...

.sply file format:

File version
Playlist name
\0
Online connection
\0
Track title 1
\0
Artist 1
\0
\0      <-- Again, note that two null chars separate the artists list and the album since one null char separates each artist.
Album
\0
Track title 2
\0

/* Familiarize yourself with some terminology:

Internal tracks  -- Audio files that staccato has a record of (specifically in the .stkl "track dictionary" file).

External tracks  -- Audio files that staccato has NOT recorded (is not in the "track dictionary"). These can be
                    tracks on the local computer system (a "local" track) or a track from an online streaming
                    service that isn't downloaded (an "online" track).

Local playlists  -- A playlist from staccato. Has an associated .sply file and can be expressed as a Playlist object.

Online playlists -- A playlist from an online streaming service. Only exists online and can only be expressed as a 
                    set of tracks (std::unordered_multiset<Track>)

Track dictionary -- The core part of staccato's file tracking system. It maps Tracks (so a title, artist, and album)
                    to file paths, and it is serialized as the .stkl file found in the "tracks" directory. In this
                    documentation, it might also be referred to as "the track dict" or "the .stkl file."
